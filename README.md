# Early-Infant-Diagnosis-with-HIV-Analysis

*Description:*
Executed a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at evaluating Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) with HIV in West and Central Africa. The initiative involved cleaning and preprocessing a dataset containing reported numbers of infants born to pregnant women living with HIV. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to discern trends and patterns.

*Tasks and Responsibilities:*
- **Data Loading and Processing:**
  - Employed Pandas to load and process the dataset efficiently.
  - Executed data cleaning procedures, addressing missing values, and ensuring data type consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Explored unique indicators related to infant diagnosis with HIV, using statistical and visual techniques.
  - Filtered and analyzed data specific to West and Central Africa, providing a region-specific perspective.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations highlighting average values of infant diagnosis over the years.
  - Visualized trends to facilitate a better understanding of the data dynamics.

- **Outlier Identification and Removal:**
  - Successfully identified and removed outliers and irrelevant data points, enhancing the quality and reliability of the analysis.

- **Machine Learning Implementation:**
  - Applied machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, to predict future values.
  - Achieved a coefficient of determination (R-Squared) of 0.73, indicating a good fit of the model.

- **Predictive Analysis:**
  - Predicted values for the years 2023 and 2024, providing valuable insights into potential trends in infant diagnosis with HIV.

*Achievements:*
- Successfully identified and addressed outliers and irrelevant data, ensuring data integrity.
- Developed insightful visualizations, aiding in the interpretation of trends and patterns.
- Implemented a robust Linear Regression model with an R-Squared value of 0.73, demonstrating a high level of predictability.
- Provided valuable predictive insights for the years 2023 and 2024, contributing to strategic planning in addressing infant diagnosis with HIV.

*Technologies Used:*
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
- Jupyter Notebooks

*Impact:*
The project's outcomes contribute significantly to understanding and addressing Early Infant Diagnosis with HIV in West and Central Africa. The predictive model equips stakeholders with valuable insights, facilitating proactive strategies and interventions to improve infant health outcomes in the region.
